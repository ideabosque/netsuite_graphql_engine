## Introduction

The **NetSuite GraphQL Engine** simplifies the interaction with the NetSuite SuiteTalk API by providing a GraphQL interface. It empowers developers to effortlessly query and manipulate NetSuite data using GraphQL syntax, facilitating seamless integration of NetSuite's powerful features into their Python applications.

### Key Features

- Query and fetch data from NetSuite with intuitive GraphQL queries.
- Create, update, or delete records in your NetSuite account using GraphQL mutations.
- Handle authentication and error handling gracefully for a seamless development experience.

This module is designed to enhance your NetSuite GraphQL experience by supporting asynchronous calls and caching using AWS DynamoDB through the PynamoDB library. By leveraging the [SuiteTalk Connector](https://github.com/ideabosque/suitetalk_connector) for API communication and PynamoDB for caching, you can combine the convenience of GraphQL with the efficiency of asynchronous calls and caching for optimal performance.
